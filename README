# pstd (pasted) - command line pastebin


Quickstart for running a pstd paste site
========================================
(To be documented in detail later, but as a quick example, this is how http://paste.pr0.tips/ is run)

$ git clone https://github.com/fstd/pstd.git
$ cd pstd
$ mkdir pastes
$ ./pstd_server.pl -l 0.0.0.0:80 -H example.com

If that worked, http://example.com/ should contain further information on how to submit pastes


Note that there is no rate limiting yet.
