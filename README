pstd (pasted) - command line pastebin (version 0.0.1)
=====================================================



Quickstart for running a pstd paste site
----------------------------------------
(To be documented in detail later, but as a quick example, this is how http://paste.pr0.tips/ is run)

$ git clone https://github.com/fstd/pstd.git
$ cd pstd
$ mkdir pastes
$ ./pstd_server.pl -l 0.0.0.0:8080 -H example.com

If that worked, http://example.com/ should contain further information on how to submit pastes

To be able to use a low-numbered port without having to run as root, a local NAT
can be done; alternatively, if running Linux, authbind(1) can be used.


Note that there is no rate limiting yet.
